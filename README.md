# Pokemon-tcg-pack-sim
A pokemon TCG pack opening simulator. Pull rates based on those reported online (mainly reddit and tcgplayer).
Currently supports packs between Scarlet Violet base set and Destined Rivals. Will add more as soon as lists and pull rates are made availiable.
Pack results and cards collected during session can be saved as a limitless import compatible text file.
